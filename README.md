DIY LTX RapidFire! Custom attachments compatible with the Lazer Tag Phoenix LTX!


This project has everything you need to make your own weapon attachments for the Lazer Tag Phoenix LTX with just a bit of soldering skill and minor reading abilities. Other kinds of attachments could be made with this code if you know what you're doing, but as-provided, it is designed for weapon-like attachments only.

Documentation is mostly written, but is not entirely complete yet.
