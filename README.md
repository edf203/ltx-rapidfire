LTX-RapidFire
=============

DIY LTX RapidFire! Custom attachments compatible with the Lazer Tag Phoenix LTX!


This project is, currently, missing half of it's files, as I have not yet received the PCB schematics or parts list from my cohort, but when complete, this will have everything you need to make your own weapon attachments for the Lazer Tag Phoenix LTX with just a bit of soldering skill and minor reading abilities. Other kinds of attachments could be made with this code if you know what you're doing, but as-provided, it is designed for weapon-like attachments only.

Documentation is still being written, but should be available soon.
