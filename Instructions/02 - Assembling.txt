To match up the parts to the correct spots, look in the ltx-rapidfire/PCB/parts-organized.txt file. Everything on this board is through-hole, so it should be nice and easy to assemble!

Here are some general tips, though:
	Start with the shortest components first.
	Start with the resistors and diodes that lay flat.
	Next, move on to the Zilog MCU.
	Get the 2x3 programming header.
	Next will probably be the resistors that sit vertically.
	Fill in the capacitors.
	Connect the LTX accessory port connector, the black wire goes to the PGND pin.

Remember that the LED will be bent sideways to be facing forward, so make sure and line this up before soldering it in!
